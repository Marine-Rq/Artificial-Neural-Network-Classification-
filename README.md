# Artificial-Neural-Network-Classification-


In this project we tried to bulild ANN model then compare the result with Classification model. 

We use in this project << Heart disease Dataset >>

From the data provided in this dataset we found that Most people who have heart disease between 55 : 65 years


### Conclusion
We tried many ways to improve the ANN model, like adding more than 3 hidden layers, trying several Activation Functions, and changing the epochs to several choices, all those tries did not improve the Accuracy more than what we got it. In our insight, ML Model gives better results as much as the data set increases.
